### About this demo-react-app

The purpose of this application is to be quickly familiar with `React.js` using the `create-react-app` command. 
I want to be comfortable understanding the different layers of `React.js` as a frontend framework <i>(some call this as a frontend library, but I choose to see this as a frontend framework)</i>. 
Furthermore, this application allows us to see about SPAs and MPAs.

<b>The goal of this is to be familiar with `components`, `props`, and `hooks`.</b>

<b>Lastly, I want to implement here <a href="https://reactpatterns.js.org/docs/component-injection/#:~:text=Passing%20(or%20inject)%20a%20component,component%20it's%20called%20Component%20Injection.">Component Injection</a></b>

### Important terminologies 

<b>Single Page Applications (SPAs)</b> is website application concept where a user is interacting with an application that is dynamically rewriting the content as they use the UI elements (components). 

In SPAs, it is an experience where a user does not have to reload the application to render new contents, rather the application 
itself is constantly rendering the required components depending on the user events. 

> A single-page application is a website that loads a single document and overwrites the existing page with new data from a web server rather than reloading pages individually from scratch. As a result, page content updates in real time based on user actions with quick transitions and without refreshing.

<b>Multi Page Applications (MPAs)</b> these are also called multi-page experiences where the user is being redirected to new contents 
via URLs. Morover, this is different in SPAs as contents in MPAs based applications have to fetch new resources from a web-server.

In simple terms, MPAs based applications require multiple HTML files.

> MPAs consist of multiple HTML pages, each representing a different section or functionality of the application.
> How They Work:
> Each page is a separate HTML file.
> User interactions trigger full page reloads as they navigate between different sections.
>The server handles rendering and serving different pages.

<b>Hooks</b> are used by functional components to handle application states and its lifecycle methods.

> In React, a Hook is a powerful feature that allows function components to hook into various React features, such as state management and lifecycle methods. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and have revolutionized how we write components.

<u>Common built-in Hooks</u>
<ul>
    <li>`useState` Allows you to manage state within a functional component.</li>
    <li>`useEffect:` Replaces lifecycle methods (such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount) for side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).</li>
    <li>`useContext:` Provides access to the context API.</li>
    <li>`useReducer:` An alternative to useState for more complex state management.</li>
    <li>`useMemo and useCallback:` Optimize performance by memoizing values and functions.</li>
</ul>

<u>Rules for Using Hooks:</u>
<ul>
    <li>Hooks can only be called inside React function components.<li>
    <li>Hooks must be called at the top level of a component (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).<li>
    <li>Hooks cannot be conditional (i.e., their order cannot change based on conditions).<li>
</ul>

### Handling Form Data from User Input using Forms

You can pass form values by capturing them when the user interacts with the form. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1. Using State (Functional Components with Hooks):
- Create a state variable to store the value of the input.
- Set an onChange event handler on the input to update the state variable when the inputâ€™s value changes.
- Set an onSubmit event handler on the form element.
- Access the value of the input field in the onSubmit event handler.

2. Using FormData (Class Components):
- Create a FormData object.
- Append the input values to the FormData object.
- Use the FormData object to send data to your server (e.g., via Axios).
    - Using `axios` is a better implementation user input must be passed into a server
    - Example: I can use `axios` to pass form values from React.js to a Spring Boot application

### SPAs vs MPAs 

| SPAs                                                                       | MPAs                                     |
| -----------                                                                | -----------                              |
| When a user enters an SPA, the server loads the whole page initially.      | Each page is a separate HTML file.       |
| User interactions (events) such as button clicking, form submissions, and links trigger AJAX request| User interactions trigger full page reloads as they navigate between different sections.
| SPA apps update the page content without reloading the entire page.        | The server handles rendering and serving different pages. |
| Faster experience without page reloads | Might have slower experience as it requires full page reloads |
| Fast and smooth user experience. Local caching for offline functionality.  Ideal for highly interactive apps. | Better SEO (each page has its own URL).  Simpler architecture for content-heavy sites. - Easier maintenance. |
| Initial load time can be slower and SEO challenges. | Slower user experience due to full page reloads. and Less interactivity. |


### Integrating Multi-Page-Experience in React.js

We can simply use the React router if we want to integrate a multi-page experience for the user.

Create React App doesn't prescribe a specific routing solution, but React Router is the most popular one.

To add it, run:

<code>npm install --save react-router-dom</code>
